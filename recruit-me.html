				Thanks for reaching out to me! Because I get a large volume of recruiter emails, most of which are for jobs that are not a good fit for me, I've created a description of what I'm looking for in my next role.

				<ul>
					<li>No jobs that require me to relocate or commute daily outside of Seattle. That means no Bellevue, no Redmond, and definitely no San Francisco or NY.
					<li>The job should be a software engineering or engineering manager job. Although I have a lot of respect for SREs and DevOps people, that sort of role isn’t for me.
					<li>The company cannot have a track record of having poor work conditions for employees and contractors with less glamorous jobs (such as warehouse employees or drivers), have active privacy scandals, legitimize racist speech, or sell its software to ICE.
					<li>I am far happier in a job when I’m working in an office with my peers. I haven’t ruled out remote work entirely, but it’s a much harder sell.
					<li>I am not interested in finance or other jobs that improve the lives of rich people while ignoring those that are not.
				</ul>

				If you think your job is a good fit for me, please fill out the form below, and if I agree, I’ll be in touch. No need to follow up. Have a good one!
